We build speech understanding and speech generation models for the five major languages spoken in Pakistan, where 42% of the adult population can not read any language.

Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world with a $411 billion GDP. Yet its overlooked and no practical voice models exist for the local languages.

With our APIs and SDKs, businesses offer high-quality voice interfaces in domains like banking, agriculture, healthcare, and government services. This enables them to finally offer digital services to every customer -- often for the first time.

Our founding team has a decade of experience building world-leading voice products, including at Alexa and Siri. We have launched entire AWS services; and software written by us previously is used by millions daily.

We do in-house research and development. We gather our own data, then train and deploy our own models. We own our technology stack end-to-end.

We are on a mission to uplift entire nations through better access to digital information and digital services.

Introducing hashtag#Balochi Orator: An AI Model that Speaks Balochi with Human-like Realism

As of today, Orator is the world's first Balochi model to achieve human like speech. 

I encourage you to try the model yourself. Request access at https://lnkd.in/dC7RnZBW

And of course, as of now we are better than OpenAI, Google and ElevenLabs in Balochi speech -- by a looong margin :)

-----------

# Why does Voice AI matter?
Coz over 42% of adults in Pakistan cannot read any language. 

# What does hashtag#UpliftAI do?
- Develop world-leading voice AI for Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, and Balochi
- Make voice technology so good and cost effective that businesses can adopt it without hesitation

# How Can You Help?
Refer forward thinking organizations that have large distribution and can use Voice AI to benefit people.

Khan Academy has officially published 104 Videos using Uplift AI's Urdu speaking AI models. A few thousand more are in the pipeline. 

Historically they have not been able to use AI voices to dub educational videos into Urdu language coz the AI Voice Models from Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and others were not good enough.

Using our Urdu speaking models, they were able to dub videos from English into Urdu in 10x less time and 100x less cost than having a professional do the dubbing. Exciting times... 

Congrats Mudassir and Zeeshan Hasan. 
Khan Academy Pakistan, Khan Academy.

One more thing... we are launching the world's best Balochi and Sindhi speaking models in a few days.

Automatically dubbing educational videos into Urdu is one of the many impactful applications of Orator, our lifelike Urdu speech model.

While such dubbing is possible in Urdu (and soon Sindhi), work is still needed on:
ðŸ‘‰ Pashto, Balochi, Punjabi, and Saraiki.

ðŸ’¡You can help us! ðŸ’¡

The simplest way to assist us is to help us find:
- Professional voice artists â€“ People with voices that are great for informational and educational content.
- Professional typists â€“ People with professional experience typing these languages.

Tag them here or 
email us at hello@upliftai.org or 
apply at upliftai.org/talent

â¸»

ðŸŽ¬ Now back to AI dubbing!
Traditionally, manually dubbing a 2-minute video can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. But with AI-assisted dubbing tools, this process can be completed in just a few minutes!

In this video, youâ€™ll see how our software analyzes the original video, translates it, and synchronizes the Urdu speech to match the on-screen content.

BTW: I could have used other Orator voices that are more suited for educational content, but I chose this one because I found it more fun!

Excited to announce that Uplift AI is backed by Y Combinator

YCombinator has a track record of creating companies that change the world a little... Like Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Instacart, Reddit, Twitch and so many more. 

UpliftAI develops world leading Voice Models for underserved languages. Nearly a billion people around the world canâ€™t read, so traditional text-based apps and websites donâ€™t work for them. With our voice models, theyâ€™ll be able to access knowledge and digital services â€” often for the very first time.

We already have the best models in the world for 3 languages. And in ~2 weeks it will be 5.... 

Extremely excited about how our work will change the world a little.... ðŸ¤ž

P.s Our co-founder Muhammad Bin Sabir couldn't make it into this photo... coz he was busy selling stuff :)
