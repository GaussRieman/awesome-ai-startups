Blue is the first voice assistant that can control every app on your phone.

Most assistants today, such as Siri, Alexa, or Gemini, are limited to narrow functions like setting timers or answering questions. They cannot message your friends on Messenger, send money on Venmo, or compare ride-share prices to book the best option.

Blue can do all of this and more.

It taps, swipes, and types like a human on both Android and iPhone, so it doesn't need any app-specific integrations. This is made possible through a voice-first computer-use model as well as a custom hardware.

It already works in the real world. Users are texting, shopping, and navigating their phones completely hands-free. People who are commuting, cooking, or multitasking are using Blue to reclaim meaningful time during their day.

Our team brings rare and highly complementary experience. Omar led Google Assistant’s transition to LLMs and holds one of the earliest patents in LLM-based computer control. Peter brings decades of experience designing and building voice-first dialog systems, holds multiple design patents, and was most recently the design lead at Google DeepMind serving actions on the Gemini Live model. Farhan helped ship Apple’s Vision Pro and holds more than 50 patents in hardware and systems design. He's also led several products end-to-end from early prototyping to mass production and global fulfillment.

Together, we have built systems used by billions of people and are now building something even more fundamental: re-inventing the way we use and interact with technology.

I’m a mechanical and product design engineer focused on building thoughtful tools for the real world. I hold 50+ patents in hardware and manufacturing, and I care deeply about how things are made and who they’re made for. For over a decade, I’ve worked across robotics, wearables, and consumer electronics. As one of the first engineers on the Apple Vision Pro, I took that product from concept to mass production.

I teach computers how to talk. For 20 years this was primarily a deterministic process of design/engineer/tune, but with the arrival of LLMs it now looks more like show/convince/tune. AI is weird, but if it can't be taught how to have a normal spoken conversation with a person, it's not going to work. This is what I work on.

I architect, design, and build speech and multi-modal interactions. My background in dialogue systems, mobile technology, and theatre has given me a unique perspective on the challenges facing the new generation of consumer devices that are just now coming to market.

Dialogue architecture is more important than ever when designing for smart speakers, social robots, chat agents, and even traditional IVR. Now that multiple I/O channels compete for product attention, understanding the capabilities and limitations of natural language interaction is key to success.

I’ve spent over four years working in social robotics and 18 working with interaction architecture, dialogue design, and NLP (natural language processing.)

Specific skills include:

Design & Engineering:
- Skills design and development
- Voice User Interface (VUI) Design
- Interaction Architecture
- Human Computer Interaction (HCI) design
- HRI design
- IoT integration
- Character/Persona development and design
- Social robotics design
- NLU grammar/rule authoring and tuning
- Performance Analysis
- User Research design and analysis
- Usability and WoZ Testing
- TTS voice creation
- Talent Coaching
- Mobile design on iOS, Android, HTML
- Audio and film production
- Tools design

Business & Product Development
- Product strategy
- ROI calculations and competitive analyses
- Sales engineering
- Requirements, business analysis, and API authoring
- Social media campaigns
- Blog authoring
- Technical troubleshooting methodology
- Customer care systems expertisePortfolio: http://www.dialoguearchitect.com/ I architect, design, and build speech and multi-modal interactions.

After nearly 7 years at Google, the siren song of start-up land has proven too tempting to withstand. I'll share more details about my venture backed by Y Combinator as I'm able.

Love and gratitude to all my friends at Google DeepMind, with special shout-outs to my CxD partners in crime April P., Daniel Padgett, Jonathan Bloom, and Jared Strawderman.

I was lucky enough to work closely with Peter for more than two years on the design team at Jibo. Peter is one of a kind. He tackles every challenge with enthusiasm, intellectual curiosity, a highly analytical mind, creativity, honesty, humor, and technical skill. He was a natural leader on our Design team, always ensuring that we stayed focused on what it means to design experiences for a social robot. Among Peter’s many rare and admirable traits, I always appreciated how he balanced his own strong and thoughtful opinions with a genuine openness to others’ ideas. I highly recommend Peter for any team, and I hope we join forces again in the future. I was lucky enough to work closely with Peter for more than two years on the design team at Jibo.

I can definitively say that Peter has made me a better designer and manager. Peter is a rare breed of designer, a skilled voice user interface architect who digs deep into business objectives to create the best possible UX. He embraces every challenge and asks the tough questions along the way. Peter is able to strike a balance of shipping minimal viable products and features while maintaining a high bar for quality and purpose. He is part designer, part engineer, part product manager—a very necessary combo for a tech startup. Peter’s diverse background, sense of humor, and passion make him a great teammate.I can definitively say that Peter has made me a better designer and manager.

AboutAbout
I’m Farhan Hossain, a founder and engineer building tools for the real world and the humanity within it.

Over the past decade, I’ve helped launch Apple's flagship products, earned over 50 patents in design and manufacturing, and led teams through the full cycle of hardware development, from concept to market.

My goal is simple: to build with care, design with purpose, and leave behind tools that serve people with dignity.

Good design honors its users.
What we make should last.
And the physical world still matters.

“Faster horses.”

Today people ask for:
 • Smarter AI
 • Week-long batteries
 • Sleek AR glasses

All great.
All expected.

What we’re building?
It’s not on anyone’s wish list.

Yet.

My friend Mohammed Mortaga is starving to death in Gaza. He was raised in Mississippi. His brother was evacuated by the Red Cross because he is a US citizen and born in the United States. However, because Mohammed had the unfortunate luck of being born in Gaza, a few years before his father traveled here to get his PhD, he and his daughter Masa are starving to death. 

Not tomorrow, not soon, today. They are starving to death today. 

He is a software engineer and building software that helps disabled Americans get housing while being bombed and attacked. 

I am posting this here because it is the only social network I have. You can listen to what a good man he is. We interviewed him for a podcast. The link is in the comments.

This is not like any of the other news we have learned to ignore. It is a genocide.

If you have a professional account and you have wondered if there is ever a context in which you should become political this is it.

This is worse than anything you have witnessed in your lifetime. I truly believe if food does not make it into Gaza thousands upon thousands of people will starve to death this weekend.

L5 is now available for anyone with an Android (Samsung, Pixel, etc) to download! 

Search "L5 Assistant" on the Play Store so you can answer all your unread emails, texts, etc on your way to work and order DoorDash on the way home :)

Our team reviews and corrects what the model did after every session so expect it to get better every week!

- Helped redefine strategy for how ML team can help improve quality, cost, and speed of LLM data generation with an in-task automated feedback system for labelers, powered in the short term by manually-configured LLM and code-based checks, then later with a zero-config agentic LLM. Deployed on XX customer projects within 3 weeks.

- Saved $Xm and eliminated key growth bottleneck by automating grading of a subset of tests given to new data labelers

- Co-founded team working to replace Google Assistant’s traditional NLU, NLG, and code-based fulfillment stack with a mid-size LLM that’s reliable, fast, and cost-efficient enough to be a positive in-place replacement for XXXm users

- Drove 2-3x improvement in model quality on the pre-launch eval sets (vs base instruction-tuned model) by building a data generation platform for our two conversation design experts to create virtually unlimited golden fine-tuning examples 

- Co-developed a powerful AutoEval system used for >90% of all model evaluations, which featured a highly-tuned LLM judge and an LLM user capable of adapting any golden multi-turn conversation to unexpected model responses- Co-founded team working to replace Google Assistant’s traditional NLU, NLG, and code-based fulfillment stack with a mid-size LLM that’s reliable, fast, and cost-efficient enough to be a positive in-place replacement for XXXm users - Drove 2-3x improvement in model quality on the pre-launch eval sets (vs base instruction-tuned model) by building a data generation platform for our two conversation design experts to create virtually unlimited golden fine-tuning examples - Co-developed a powerful AutoEval system used for >90% of all model evaluations, which featured a highly-tuned LLM judge and an LLM user capable of adapting any golden multi-turn conversation to unexpected model responses…see more
