This is where real friendships begin. Women speak with our AI coach for 10 minutes to map personality, preferences, and availability. We then host recurring, guided meetups with compatible local matches and keep her social life on track with planning, suggestions, and check-ins.

RealRoots üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the mobile friendship app for women
See original launch post
TL;DR - Women speak to an AI coach via voice, and get matched with compatible real-life women in her city for meaningful social experiences.

https://youtu.be/rggGrOmMdUM



THE PROBLEM:

Making friends as an adult is hard. Women lose half of their friends every 7 years, and yet there is no easy way to rebuild those circles. This fundamental problem has led to ‚Öî of Americans regularly feeling lonely to no fault of their own.

THE SOLUTION:

We know that friendships form when three ingredients align: 1) compatibility, 2) repeat encounters, and 3) authentic conversations. That‚Äôs why we designed RealRoots to reliably deliver all three, allowing us to guarantee friendships.

Friendship compatibility: A woman speaks to an AI coach via voice for 5-10 minutes, allowing us to determine the compatibility traits that are most important to her.
Repeat Encounters: When a woman joins RealRoots, she commits to meeting her friend matches for multiple shared experiences, allowing enough repetition for connection to develop.
Authentic Conversations: RealRoots experiences are led by a trained facilitator, who guides deep conversations and icebreakers so that a woman gets to know her matches intentionally.
A woman can join for 6 weeks, a year, or longer. Throughout she has access to an  AI coach that helps her organize her social calendar and more.
WHY WE‚ÄôRE BUILDING THIS:

We‚Äôre building the product we desperately wished existed. After moving 10 times between us, we‚Äôve repeatedly felt the struggle of rebuilding a community from scratch, and the isolation that follows. We created RealRoots because we want to solve this problem, for ourselves and for every woman seeking genuine connection.

OUR ASK:

Take an AI personality quiz  (available to all genders): Spend 5 minutes chatting via voice with our AI and unlock personalized insights about how you come across to others. Continue your journey of self-discovery by downloading the RealRoots mobile app (Apple Appstore, Google Play).
Meet friend matches (women only): Have any female loved ones who are looking for new friends? Spread the word about RealRoots. And if you‚Äôre a woman, we‚Äôd love to help you meet your new local friend group.
