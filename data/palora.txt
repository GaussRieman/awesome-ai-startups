Paloma is a modular quote-to-cash stack that lets you manage pricing, quoting, and billing processes using natural language.

B2B quoting and billing systems are stuck in the past. Rigid configurations and overly templatized rules slow down businesses, lead to erroneous manual processes , and result in fragmented sources of truths. Paloma lets you define your business rules in natural language, integrate your playbooks into the sales and quoting process, and automate bespoke billing processes for each of your contracts.

1. Built the organisation structure managing the payroll execution process across 100+ countries for all payroll related products (EOR, GP). Operational team that I managed peaked at 53 subordinates

2. Ran a project to shift the payroll cutoff date from the 15th of the month to the 20th. This required optimisation problems in payroll processing, opening up new bank accounts for payment execution timelines and resourcing all related teams to handle the much tighter deadlines. Started in July 2023 with a staged approach, the final countries were shifted to the 20th early in 2024

3. Business unit owner for EOR - Developed OKRs for the EOR product and worked with PMs to create and iterate on the product roadmap (EOR was generating $13mil in recurring revenue monthly in January 2024)

Scoped requirements for PMs and engineers and partnered with them throughout the product development process until deployment and further iterations

3. Independently managed the coordination of December and other irregular payment deadlines which required cross department and product coordination and delivery

1. Coordinated a cross-department project where the goal was to improve customer experience by reducing locked accounts and complaints. We managed to reduce FinCrime related complaints by over 50% (From 2.2k complaints per month to 1.1k) and locked accounts by 25% (260k to 195k) in a period of 6 months.

2. Reduced FinCrime department’s cost per MAU by over 20% in a 6 month period by providing MI for targeted decision making, working with Product teams to quantify the impact of their road map and deliver efficiency gains and precision improvements as expected

3. Developed a fraud reporting tool to standardise how our partners escalate fraud cases to us. This allowed automation actions such as locking of accounts so that fraudsters are stopped faster and we recovered 8x more funds for victims.

4. Performed large scale fraud investigations using data and insights to improve controls and prevent future fraudsters from being able to take advantage of Revolut's customers

AboutAbout
Currently working as the Director of Engineering at Deel, a series-E unicorn startup. I help to look after teams that ensure payments get delivered to our users in a reliable and predictable way, transferring millions internationally on a monthly basis to more than 100 countries. My day-to-day responsibilities include streamlining the team's processes, facilitating the team to deliver high quality software at a rapid pace, prioritising and scoping projects, coordinating between various stakeholders and dependencies, and ensuring the team members are fulfilling their career ambitions. 

I was previously a software engineer on the Communication Channels team at Bloomberg L.P. in London for over 3 years, where I worked primarily with C++ and Python on a day-to-day basis. Took part in various projects to improve and renovate Bloomberg Terminal's key communication products in IB and MSG. I actively worked on upgrading the data pipelines from using existing, proprietary technologies to using Kafka.

I graduated from Imperial College London in 2017 with first class Honours in MEng Computing. During my studies, I took special interests in Computer Vision / Machine Learning systems, as well as industry-focused software systems/engineering principles. 

My main area of interests are large-scale, distributed systems designs, and solving challenging but relevant technical problems, as well as innovative technological solutions to the problems that our society faces today. I enjoy working in co-operative environments, and I am always excited to dive into domains/technologies that I have not worked with previously.Currently working as the Director of Engineering at Deel, a series-E unicorn startup.

Claude 4 Opus haiku of this post: 

Leaving Deel behind— 
Photobombed by fate's design, 
AI calls me home.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't get that last bit either. 

Anyways, longer version of the post: 

6 weeks ago when I got the call from Y Combinator, I dropped everything in my life in an instant to jump on the opportunity. Today we got photobombed by the man who started it all. Building yet another chatGPT wrapper was my destiny, so it seems. 

Whilst at Deel, there almost was a time dilation effect where you're so used to progress and growth at lightning speed, that everything else slowed down around you. Now starting from scratch again in the search for PMF, It's been far from smooth sailing. Everyday is a never-ending cycle of talking to users, scratching heads, and getting closer to building something that people want. 

I want to also give a shoutout to the Deel family, it's been a privilege sharing such a special journey with all of you, and I will always be rooting for you.

I worked as a member of the Communications Channels engineering team. The main responsibility of my team is to renovate and maintain the messaging distribution pipelines that facilitate two of the most widely-used communciation products in IB and MSG.

During my time here I worked as a scrum master for the team, and also took part in projects such as
- re-architecturing IB and MSG distrubtion systems,
- re-designing and implementing user presence systems with C++, Python, and Kafka
- adding new features to the IB application,
- reworking IB integration with other Terminal functions

On the job I primarily used C++ and Python on a day to day basis, leveraging other technologies such as Kafka, Protobuf, Docker, and Cmake for our projects and testing.

Enterprise-grade robustness with startup-level agility
abstract illustration
Fully modular
Use quoting and billing together for a seamless quote-to-cash flow or run them independently alongside your existing tools. Start where you need the most help and expand at your own pace.

abstract illustration
No-code
From product list setup to billing rules, everything can be configured in plain English. If you can describe it, Paloma can handle it.

abstract illustration
Ingest any source of truth
Upload PDFs, forward emails, or sync CRM chatter. Paloma can read and understand any input format without forcing you into a rigid template.

abstract illustration
Customized human-in-the-loop
Define exactly what needs approval and how each approval flow should work. Paloma learns from every decision so over time, fewer quotes and invoices require manual review.

abstract illustration
Searchable knowledge base
Ask questions like “Who has 30-day net payment terms?” or “Which contracts have volume discounts?” and get instant answers from your deal history.

abstract bg
Built for Growth
Paloma is for teams that want agility at scale. Try new models, tweak terms, run bespoke deals without worrying about how you'll track or bill them.

We've built and scaled quoting, invoicing, billing, and payroll at rocketships like Deel and Revolut.

Now we're combining our best practices with the latest in AI to reimagine quote-to-cash from the ground up.

abstract bg
What we’re building next
Interactive deal rooms
Visually rich, collaborative spaces where you can share sales collateral, leave comments and align with clients on deal terms.

Reusable logic playbooks
Turn “how we handle X” into structured playbooks. From fee waivers to pricing floors, codify your tribal knowledge across quoting and billing.

Proactive suggestions
We monitor your customer conversations and flag billing-impacting exceptions like ad hoc discounts or credits for you to review before the invoices go out.

Renewals tracking
Stay ahead of every renewal with automated alerts, usage-based upsell suggestions and full deal history so nothing slips through the cracks.

abstract bg
An engine with real world depth
Experience quote-to-cash built to handle every dimension of how you sell.
